## My process

I made this by utilizing a container that acts as an inner container to hold the image and two paragraphs. Next, the container is nested inside another container for the purpose of centering all the existing content. To center, I made the outermost container as a flexbox with a height of 100vh, then made the justify-content and align-items properties to center. After that, I perfected the result by adding the styles.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The important thing I learned was how to center an element (or in this case container) vertically using flexbox and set the height to 100vh.

### Continued development

Currently I still don't understand how to center elements, both vertically and horizontally. I hope to perfect the technique I use in the future. feel free to give me suggestions, input and criticism.
